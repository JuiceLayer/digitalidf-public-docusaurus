# Project Security Guidelines

1. **You are responsible**: As a responsible team member working on this project, you play a crucial role in ensuring its security.

2. **RTFM!** (Read the Freaking Manual!): Before seeking help, make sure to explore available resources such as Github, Wiki, Teams, Google, docs, and even ChatGPT. Often, the answers you need are already out there.

3. **Consult Early**: Reach out for advice and guidance before making critical decisions. It's better to discuss potential solutions proactively than dealing with issues later.

4. **Self-Service is Key**: We have provided you with powerful tools. Utilize them to their fullest potential. Many tasks can be handled independently through self-service options.

5. **Use Github Issues**: When communicating about the project, prefer using Github Issues over WhatsApp messages or phone calls. This way, discussions are well-documented and easier to track.

6. **Group-Based Permissions**: Remember, permissions should be granted to groups rather than individual users. This approach ensures better manageability and security.

7. **Automation for Repetitive Tasks**: Whenever possible, automate monotonic and repetitive tasks. Automation helps reduce human errors and improves efficiency.

8. **Sanitize Inputs Always**: Regardless of the source, always sanitize inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like code injection or cross-site scripting.

9. **Traffic within DigitalIDF Systems**: Traffic between two DigitalIDF systems is considered internal and should not traverse the Internet.

10. **Restricting Traffic between Systems**: By default, traffic between two systems should be disallowed. It should be opened only when deemed necessary and justified for specific purposes.

Remember, security is a shared responsibility. Let's work together to maintain a secure and robust project environment.
